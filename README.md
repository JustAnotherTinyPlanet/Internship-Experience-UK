# Internship-Experience-UK
I am a starter in coding and this program is really a challenge to me. 
I spent several hours figuring out why the given code kept reporting errors, installing pycharm and learning to use it. 
I also got stuck quite frequently, so it can be seen that I only finished a small part of part 1.
However, I believe I've learnt something through this process. I will keep working on it later.
* I only made changes in video_player.py.
